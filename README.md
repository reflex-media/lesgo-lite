Bootstrap your next Node.js serverless microservice project with a bare minimum lightweight template built on top of the Serverless Framework.

> **NOTE:** This is not an introduction to the Serverless Framework. You would already need to know how Serverless Framework works prior to using of this template.

Lesgo! Lite provides the bare minimum template to quickly build a simple HTTP REST API endpoint. For a more complex project with examples, use the [Lesgo!](https://github.com/reflex-media/lesgo) template instead.

Refer to the [Getting Started](https://reflex-media.github.io/lesgo-docs/getting-started/installation/) guide to start development.
